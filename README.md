# Memory Allocation Simulator

A simple C project that simulates memory allocation and deallocation. The simulator includes a basic first-fit memory allocation algorithm and allows users to create, allocate, and deallocate memory for processes. This project serves as a starting point for understanding memory management concepts and can be extended with more advanced memory allocation algorithms.

## Introduction

This project provides a basic memory allocation simulator written in C. It demonstrates a simple first-fit memory allocation algorithm and includes functionalities for creating, allocating, and deallocating memory for processes.

## Features

- First-fit memory allocation algorithm.
- Ability to create processes and allocate/deallocate memory for them.
- User interface for interaction.

## Usage

1. **Building the Project:**
    - Clone the repository.
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Run the `make` command to build the project.

2. **Running the Simulator:**
    - Execute the compiled executable (e.g., `./memory_allocation_simulator`).
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the simulator.

## Building the Project

To build the project, make sure you have a C compiler installed. Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.
