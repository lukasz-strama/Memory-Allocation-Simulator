# Memory-Allocation-Simulator
 A simple C project that simulates memory allocation and deallocation. The simulator includes a basic first-fit memory allocation algorithm and allows users to create, allocate, and deallocate memory for processes. This project serves as a starting point for understanding memory management concepts and can be extended with more advanced memory allocation algorithms.
